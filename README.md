# SLC Game Studio: Gentrifica-Town

_created by Austin Poor_

A Unity game I created in 2018 for Angela Ferraiolo's course at Sarah Lawrence College, [Game Studio: Radical Game Design](https://www.sarahlawrence.edu/faculty/ferraiolo-angela.html#accordion-previously-taught-course-game-studio-radical-game-design). You can read more about Game Studio and Angela's courses [here](http://astoryisnotatree.net/).

The core idea of the game centers around gentrification in NYC. You can read more about my game in the [blog posts folder](blogPosts/).
